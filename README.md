# ADVANCED-DOM-BANKIST-APP
This project, an advanced demonstration of DOM event handling, showcases various techniques including event propagation (capturing and bubbling), event delegation, lazy loading of images, and managing the DOM lifecycle efficiently.

## Key features :

- Event Handling: Demonstrates a deep understanding of event propagation, capturing, and bubbling, along with the practical application of event delegation for dynamic content.

- DOM Manipulation: Utilizes DOM manipulation techniques effectively to create interactive user interfaces and optimize performance.

- Browser APIs: Integrates browser APIs such as the Intersection Observer for creating sticky navigation and lazy loading of images, enhancing user experience and page performance.

- Code Optimization: Implements efficient coding practices, including modularization and code reuse, to ensure maintainability and scalability of the project.
